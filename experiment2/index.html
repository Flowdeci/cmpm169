				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this experment I wanted to make an interative leaf falling simulator.
					The goal of this experiment was to create a relaxing and visually appealing, interactive simulation
					of leaves falling.
					By using the p5.js library, we were able to generate realistic leaf movements and interactions with
					the environment.
					The user can interact with their mouse to create wind gusts that affect the leaves.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The velocity of the leaves is all implemented in the leaf.js class.
					The leaves each have theri own sepreate velocitys with a slight amount of randomness in how mucht he
					windForce affects them.
					The windforce is calculated by how fast the mouse is moved from one spot to anthor while it is being
					dragged. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to correcly use velocity on the leaves.
					Before, we just changed the x and y position of the leaves, but that was not very realistic.
					By implementing velocity and acceleration, we were able to create more natural and fluid movements.
					This added a layer of complexity to the simulation, making it more engaging and lifelike.
					However I wasnt able to fully finish the WindStreak class, so the wind gusts are not as visually
					appealing as I would have liked.
