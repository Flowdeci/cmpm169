				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this assignment is to create an interactive garden where the user can grow
					and watter plants. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The user is able to grow plants in wind mode and affect the sway of the plants in a specific
					direction using
					the arrow keys. To switch to water mode the user presses 'e' (to go back to wind mode press 'w').
					The user can then
					hold left click to drop water dropplets that will bosst the growth of a plant even at night.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The plant class was esspically hard to implement for this project. There where a plethera of
					difficulitues such as getting the blossom of the plant
					to stay with the stem, ensuring the water particles interacted correctly with the plant, and getting
					the leaves to appear in the correct spot
					. Despite these challenges, the project was a great learning experience in handling complex
					interactions in p5.js.
