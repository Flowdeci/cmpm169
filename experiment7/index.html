				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project visualizes sound input as dynamic, colorful rings that expand, shrink, and pulse based
					on microphone input. It aims to create an interactive and visually appealing representation of audio
					in real-time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The project uses p5.js sound addon to capture microphone input and map the sound levels to the size,
					thickness,
					and color of concentric rings. Easing and pulsing effects are applied for smooth and natural
					transitions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> This project was both challenging and rewarding, requiring experimentation with sound mapping and
					smooth transitions. It was exciting to see the visuals respond in real-time to sound input. However
					I feel that I couldve done more with the project but ran out of time.</p>
